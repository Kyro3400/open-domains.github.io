# Introduction

Welcome to Open Domains! We're excited to have you here. Open Domains is a project that aims to provide free domain names to anyone who wants one. We believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to create a website, and we want to make it as easy as possible for people to get started.

## How it works

We own a number of domains that we allow people to use for free. You can choose a domain from our list and create a subdomain for your project. For example, if you wanted to create a website for your blog, you could choose the subdomain `blog.is-not-a.dev`.

## Why we're doing this

We believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to create a website. We know that getting started can be difficult, especially if you're new to web development. By providing free domain names, we hope to make it easier for people to get started and share their projects with the world.


## The PSL

The Public Suffix List (PSL) is a list of domain suffixes that are used by browsers to determine the boundaries of cookies. We use the PSL to ensure that our subdomains are treated as separate entities by browsers. This helps to protect the privacy and security of our users.
