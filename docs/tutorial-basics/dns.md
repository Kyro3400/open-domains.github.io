# Understanding DNS Record Types

DNS (Domain Name System) is essential for translating domain names into IP addresses, enabling browsers to find websites. Here's a quick guide to different DNS record types you might encounter:

## **A Record**

- **Purpose**: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
- **Example**: `example.com` → `192.0.2.1`

## **AAAA Record**

- **Purpose**: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
- **Example**: `example.com` → `2001:db8::1`

## **CNAME Record**

- **Purpose**: Alias for another domain name. It points one domain name to another.
- **Example**: `www.example.com` → `example.com`

## **MX Record**

- **Purpose**: Specifies the mail servers responsible for receiving emails for the domain.
- **Example**: `example.com` → `mail.example.com`

## **TXT Record**

- **Purpose**: Stores text-based information related to the domain, often used for verification and security purposes.
- **Example**: `example.com` → `"v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all"`

## **SRV Record**

- **Purpose**: Defines the location of servers for specific services, like VoIP or instant messaging.
- **Example**: `_sip._tcp.example.com` → `sipserver.example.com`


## **CAA Record**

- **Purpose**: Specifies which certificate authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates for the domain.
- **Example**: `example.com` → `0 issue "letsencrypt.org"`
