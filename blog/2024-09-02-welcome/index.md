Welcome to the Open Domains blog! This is the first post on the blog, and I'm excited to share more about the project with you. Open Domains is a project that aims to provide free domain names to anyone who wants one. We believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to create a website, and we want to make it as easy as possible for people to get started.
